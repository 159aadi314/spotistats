# Spotify Stats Site

> A site to see your recent top tracks, playlists and artists

This Site made with __Nodejs__ and __react__ helps its users to see their __Spotify__ profile with their recently played tracks, public playlists and recent artists using the [spotify api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). 

This is a beginnner's project to learn basic react routing, adding components, using hooks, API calls using axios and other stuff.
